This repository contains the code and documentation for the SWEP 2025 project. The project is an extension to the work done in 2022. Please refer to the quick start guide for information on how to operate the system. To learn how the system works and possible problems and solutions, refer to the other documentation files. For information on the implementation, refer to the inline comments. Before editing or reworking the system please read through the accompanying documentation. The code is written in Python, and C++(Arduino IDE) with a focus on OOP and was designed to be run on a moderately powerful Windows laptop (4 cores, 16GB RAM) and with an ethernet connection.
